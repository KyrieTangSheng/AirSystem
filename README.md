# AirSystem

A database project done by Kyrie Tang Sheng and Flora Wenye Jiang.

People can register and log in as customers, booking agents, or airline staff. 
People can also view public information without logging in.

Customers will be able to view his/her flights, purchase tickets, cancel ticket and get refund, search for flights and track spending.
Booking agents will be able to view commission, view top customers besides their basic needs to purchase tickets for customers.
Airline staff with different permissions are able to do different stuff, including view top destinations, view revenue, etc. 

Run init.py in ./source_code/ to run the web application. 

Need to collaborate with xampp mysql. 
Just focusing on functions so far. Will update CSS styles to make the UI look more beautiful.
